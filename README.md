# Shopify Image Repository --  [fanimage.net](https://fanimage.net)

### CHALLENGE
The task was to build an image repository api. It was an open ended task, restricted to nothing but imagination. The goal was to create an api that allows users to add, remove, and view images.

### INSPIRATION
This app was created to support the shopify image repository api backend challenge. This client app works asynchronously to give users a graphical user interface to access the image repository.

### ROADMAP
To date, the current site has the ability to add, remove, and view images (if user is authenticated). Tags have also been added to each image to allow searching in future versions. Buying and selling images is not in the roadmap as of now due to the possible legal complications.
